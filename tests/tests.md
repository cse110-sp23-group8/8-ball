Visual appearance: Ensure that the website looks as expected on different devices, screen sizes, and browsers. This includes checking the layout, images, and text styling.

Character selection: Test the ability to select different characters (SpongeBob, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs) and ensure that only one character can be selected at a time.

Question input: Verify that the text input field for questions accepts text properly and that empty questions or those containing only whitespace are not allowed.

Submit button: Test the submit button to ensure that it triggers the question processing, plays the sound effect, and generates a random response from the selected character's set of messages.

Message display: Check that the response message is displayed correctly, along with the animated bubbles, and that the message is cleared when a new question is asked.

Sound effect: Ensure that the correct sound effect is played for each character, and the sound plays for the desired duration (3 seconds in this case).

User experience: Test the overall user experience, such as response time, button clicks, and any potential edge cases or user interactions that may cause issues.
